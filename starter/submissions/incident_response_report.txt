1. Incident commander name: 
    Singam

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
    Falco runtime monitoring detected security breach and was reported on Falco Dashboard via Grafana. 
    Crypto miners pods were executed in the cluster resulting in CPU and memory usage spikes.

3. Summary of what was affected:
    The attacker managed to run crypto miners on our system, which is a security breach. The Kubernetes API server had been compromised and 
    accessed by an unauthorised personal to introduce and execute the pods. This affects the whole cluster's performance and security.

4. Summmry of the impact:
    This has caused a spike in CPU and memory utilisation. Also Falco detected crypto miners using the stratum protocol based on Crypto rules.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
    Run the following command to evict the pods:
        `kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>`
    Now that the prods are evicted, check the Grafana dashboard again for CPU utilization. The CPU utilization shall start to fall as the crypto mining pods are evicted.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
    Administrative terminals and authentication credentials should be accessible by authorised personal only. Admission controllers can also be
    configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.
