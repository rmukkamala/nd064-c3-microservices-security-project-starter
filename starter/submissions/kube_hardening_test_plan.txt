How will you test the changes?

There are three environments: development, staging and production. I will test the changes in the development environment first to test out the 
Kubernetes functionality and performance after hardening. As the hardening can affect the behavior of etcd, master and control plane. 
I will also monitor metrics that are available through observability and monitoring techniques using 
Prometheus and Grafana to make these changes do not degrade performance and generate extraneous loads on the system. 

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?

There should be a checklist to check the cluster components and services that would be affected. These checks should be done before and
after the change is done to confirm if the change does not cause any unforeseen service outage. A reverse plan should be inplace to revert the
changes if environment is negatively affected. Finally, and also important, the cluster should have backups in case a restore is needed in worst
case scenario.
